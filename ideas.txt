you are a ghost: a woman who died of grief because her husband and lord disappeared at war/dragon slaying
you come back to find out what happened

mechanics
you cannot interact with the world yourself, you need to take possession of NPC
your power level tells you what NPC you can take possession of/what you can get them to do
	your power > NPC power to possess him and get him to do "ethic" things 
	your power > NPM power * factor to get him to do something against its ethics
	temporary boosts of power?
quests can be done as specific character, but more complex quests will require to possess several characters
quests -> XP -> raise power (power = level, more or less)
how can you lose?
	- energy level get depleted? How is that linked to power?
	- sanity? for a ghost?
	- despair/hope
NPC have inventory so they can carry quest items
can you cross walls? Maybe walls have power too...
